## MASE verification (R)

This repository contains R scripts to verify the computation of
Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) as defined by Hyndman.

The implementation follows the methods described in the original paper
and reproduces MASE values using multiple forecasting approaches on
example time series.
