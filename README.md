## MASE verification (R)

This repository contains R scripts to verify the computation of
Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) as defined by Hyndman.

The implementation follows the methods described in the original paper
and reproduces MASE values using multiple forecasting approaches on
example time series.
### Code
The R script contains code for all three time series used in the MASE verification.
### Reference
The file `mase.pdf` contains the paper whose MASE definition and methods are verified in this repository.
